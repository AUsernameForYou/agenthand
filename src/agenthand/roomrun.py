"""ROOM RUN — the multi-item room intake layer (prototype, not an MCP tool).

agenthand started as a one-photo chain: identify -> cut_out -> draw turns
ONE product photo into a staged listing with a Fidelity Lock receipt. The
product Daniel locked on 2026-10-28 (tracker decision 51) is room-scale:
the seller walks a room, names what goes ("this cup, this bear, this
chair"), and gets one staged listing per item — every item with its own
receipt. This module is that intake layer. It orchestrates the three
shipped tools over a SET of room photos (stills, plus frames sampled
from a walkthrough video); it adds no model calls of its own and is NOT
a fourth MCP tool — the three-tool surface stays exactly as shipped.

Pipeline:

0. Narration (optional). A narrated video or audio file the seller
   recorded while walking the room is transcribed by ONE Muse Spark
   Open call via Baseten (the narration link, added 2026-10-28). The
   call returns the verbatim transcript plus two item lists: SELLING
   — items the speaker explicitly marks for sale — and MENTIONED —
   items referred to in passing. Selling items join the work list as
   named items; mentioned items join it too, flagged as mentioned,
   so the visual pipeline below confirms or refutes each against the
   frames — a mentioned item is never silently dropped and never
   silently promoted to a listing the seller did not ask for. The
   transcript is stored beside the manifest and quoted in it.
   Narration failure (no audio track, a silent track, a refused or
   failed call) is an error row in the manifest, never an aborted
   room: with stills or typed items present the run continues
   stills-only.
1. Sources. Stills from the given files/dirs, plus frames sampled from
   each given video with ffmpeg (fixed interval, timestamps recorded).
   A video frame is just another source photo with provenance.
2. Plan pass. identify runs once per source photo. Its plan powers
   photo ranking, auto-enumerate mode, and listing copy (when the
   plan's concept actually matches the item — see the honesty note
   below). A photo whose plan fails is still ingested and probed;
   it just ranks blind.
3. Per item. Candidate photos are ranked by token overlap between the
   item's name and each photo's plan text (stills before frames on
   ties — they are sharper and larger). The probe cap can never drop
   a still: every still photo is always in the candidate set, and
   video frames fill the cap's remaining slots in rank order (probe
   order inside the set stays the rank order). cut_out probes the
   candidates with the item's name as the SAM concept (plus bounded
   deterministic variants: the photo plan's own phrase when it overlaps
   the name, a colour-stripped form, the head noun). Every probe is a
   sighting, success or failure, and lands in the manifest.
4. De-dup. One named item = one listing: its successful sightings
   across photos are the same physical item seen from several angles;
   the primary sighting (most opaque foreground pixels, the closest /
   clearest view) is the one staged, the rest are recorded as
   also-seen-in. In auto-enumerate mode, per-photo candidates are
   grouped by concept similarity — a group merges ONLY on strong
   evidence (high token similarity, or similar names whose masks on
   near-duplicate viewpoints overlap); the grey zone keeps both
   candidates and flags them possible duplicates. Across items, two
   listings whose primary foregrounds are pixel-identical, or whose
   primary masks on the same photo almost perfectly overlap, are
   flagged as possible duplicates of each other. The cross-item
   check runs at sighting level: any two successful sightings of
   two staged items, on the same photo, whose masks overlap at
   least 95% of the smaller mask also link the items as possible
   duplicates, primaries or not. NOTHING is ever silently merged
   away: a flag keeps both listings and says why.
   One collision shape gets a repair attempt on top of the flag:
   when a colliding sighting pair involves at least one item's
   primary, the object is contested; when exactly one item's own
   listing evidence names that item and not the other, the keeper
   keeps the object and the other item is displaced, but only when
   its own primary is one of the colliding sightings — it
   re-stages from its largest successful sighting that does not
   collide with any of the keeper's sightings, when it has one,
   under a fresh receipt and verification. A keeper whose primary
   is not the contested object is never moved. Ambiguous evidence,
   no clean alternate sighting, a failed re-stage, or a re-stage
   the run budget cannot cover all leave the original staged
   result standing. Duplicate flags are never removed by a
   re-selection: they describe the probing ambiguity, and the
   re-selection flag and run note record the resolution.
5. Stage. In the default "scene" stage mode, draw runs the primary
   foreground with ONE shared scene prompt for the whole room (the
   room's plate style), so the set of listings reads as one room's
   worth of staging. In the "wallpaper" and "studio_gray" stage
   modes the plate is rendered in code at the foreground's frame
   size (no model call, no spend), stored as a plate asset, and
   drawn through the same compositor, so the receipt pins the
   plate's hashes and names it code-rendered. The per-item fidelity
   receipt is the draw tool's own, persisted beside the composite
   in the store and linked from the manifest.
6. Verify. A staged item is not believed on draw's say-so: the
   repo's independent verifier (composite.verify_receipt_from_disk)
   re-reads the item's stored source, foreground, and composite
   files, re-checks their hashes, and recounts the changed opaque
   pixels from disk. Its verdict lands in the manifest as the item's
   "verification" field, distinct from the draw receipt it checks.
   An item whose verification fails is reported verify_failed, not
   staged — the demo-ready Gauntlet's fix #1: a room run "verifies
   end to end" only when an independent path re-proves each item.
7. Manifest. JSON + a readable summary: room id, sources, per-item
   status (staged / failed / verify_failed, with the stage and error
   that failed it), receipt links and pixel counts, the independent
   verification per item, sightings, duplicate flags, and the run's
   total cost read as the delta of the run's own cost ledger across
   the run — the amounts the spend cap actually counted, failed
   attempts included. Partial failure is a first-class outcome: a
   room where four items stage and two honestly fail is a successful
   room run with a truthful manifest.

Honesty notes (v1 limits, stated rather than smoothed over):

- identify plans ONE primary subject per photo. In a crowded room
  photo its listing copy describes that subject, so whole-photo
  listing copy is attached ONLY when the photo plan's concept
  matches the item. When it does not, the item-crop path runs
  instead: the primary source photo is cropped to the item's own
  foreground box (10% margin, clamped), the crop is stored as an
  asset, and identify runs on the crop. Only a successful crop
  identify attaches copy (source "item_crop"); any failure leaves
  the manifest saying copy was not generated for the item instead
  of dressing it in another item's words. Auto-enumerate likewise
  surfaces one candidate per viewpoint; several viewpoints of one
  room are what surface several items.
- The seller's name is the segmentation concept. SAM sometimes wants
  a different phrasing than a human uses; the bounded variant list is
  the recovery, and a name no variant can segment is a failed item
  with NO_MATCH in the manifest, never a quietly substituted object.

Spend discipline: every Meta model call goes through the shipped
tools, so every Meta dollar flows through meta_client.billed_call
under its fail-closed cap. The ONE exception is the narration call,
which is not a Meta API call: it runs on Baseten's Muse Spark Open
deployment and draws on the $100 Baseten partner credit pool, a pool
separate from the Meta ledger. Its usage and estimated cost are
recorded in the manifest's narration section, never in the room
total, and a per-call projection cap refuses an absurd call before
it is made. Room
runs keep their OWN ledger (default: ledger.jsonl inside the output
dir; --ledger overrides): during a run, AGENTHAND_LEDGER_PATH points
at the room ledger so every receipt the run causes lands there, and
the server's cumulative ledger — the one the published proof run's
accounting lives in — is never touched by an experiment (demo-ready
Gauntlet separation gate). The per-run budget (default $1.00) plus
the worst-case projection checked before the first call are the
binding bounds on room spend; the manifest's total is the room
ledger's delta across the run.

# Spark Open always reasons before it answers, and the reasoning grows
# with the clip. The voice spike showed a 1024-token cap fully consumed
# by reasoning, leaving an empty reply; 4096 covered the short spikes
# but not a real walkthrough: on Daniel's 58.9 s backyard clip the
# model's reasoning alone ran 5,474 tokens (5,668 completion total)
# before any answer text, so the shipped 4096 cap returned an empty
# reply (film run P12, 2026-10-31; the same call at an 8000 cap
# recovered the full transcript and sort). The cap is 16384 PER PIECE:
# narration splits any clip longer than NARRATION_CHUNK_SECONDS into
# pieces (below), so no single call ever faces more than a minute of
# audio. A minute at the worst observed reasoning rate (~121 tokens/s,
# the 24 s voice spike) needs ~7,300 reasoning tokens plus its share
# of transcript, so 16384 carries >2x headroom per piece; for the
# 58.9 s diagnostic clip in one piece it is ~2.9x the whole observed
# completion. The cap is a fixed constant rather than duration-scaled
# on purpose: billing is per token actually used, so the cap only
# feeds the cost projection; a formula would add cross-build parity
# surface for no billing benefit. A piece whose reasoning still eats
# the whole budget fails loudly with a correction path (see

    """Run one room end to end and return (and write) its manifest.

    probe_all_candidates: when True (the default), every ranked
    candidate photo is probed for sightings even after a success —
    that cross-photo evidence is what the de-dup record is built
    from. When False, probing stops at the first success per item
    (cheaper, thinner manifest).

    ledger_path: the run's own cost ledger. The default is
    ledger.jsonl inside out_dir — room runs are experiments and
    never spend against the server's cumulative ledger (the one the
    published proof run's accounting lives in). For the run's
    duration AGENTHAND_LEDGER_PATH points at this ledger, so every
    receipt billed_call writes for the run lands in it; the previous
    value is restored on exit. The manifest records the path and its
    total is this ledger's delta across the run.

    verify_fn: (store, composite_handle) -> verifier report. The
    default is the repo's independent verifier
    (composite.verify_receipt_from_disk) — every staged item is
    re-proven from the stored files before the manifest calls it
    staged.

    narrated_videos / narrated_audios: inputs whose narration names
    the items. Each gets ONE Baseten Muse Spark Open call through
    narration_fn (default: _default_narration_fn) after its audio is
    extracted and measured; the call's projection is refused above
    narration_max_projected_usd. Selling items from the transcript
    join the work list as named items; mentioned items join flagged,
    for the visual pipeline to confirm or refute. Narration spend is
    Baseten-pool only and lands in the manifest's narration section,
    never in total_cost_usd (the Meta ledger delta).

    stage_mode: "scene" (default) stages through the model draw
    chain; "wallpaper" / "studio_gray" stage on code-rendered
    plates (see the module docstring). The manifest records the
    mode at top level and on every item record.

    comps_data: agent-supplied Marketplace comps (the parsed --comps
    JSON). Every item record gains a deterministic pricing record
    from market_pricing; when comps are supplied the run also
    writes the priced table artifacts (priced-table.png,
    priced-table.html, pricing-notes.md) into out_dir.
