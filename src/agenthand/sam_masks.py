"""SAM 3.1 mask wire format: THE PARSER SWAP BOUNDARY.

Everything agenthand knows about how SAM 3.1 returns segmentation —
special-token text with base85 mask payloads — lives in this module and
nowhere else. Behind the boundary sits Meta's official parser package,
``meta-sam-parser`` (PyPI, by Meta Platforms, Inc.; the Python
implementation of the SAM 3 segmentation protocol, companion to the
TypeScript parser). If Meta revises the wire format, or the parser is
ever swapped for another implementation, this module is the only file
that changes: the rest of agenthand consumes ``DecodedMask`` objects —
a full-frame binary raster plus record metadata — and never sees a
payload string.

Wire format (as parsed by the official package): the model's output
text is one line per frame, ``<Nf>`` then comma-separated records
``id<|box;x1=..;y1=..;x2=..;y2=..;w=<frameW>;h=<frameH>|><|mask;x=0;y=0;data=<H>,<W>,<payload>|>``.
Box corners are inclusive on the wire; the parser normalizes them to
half-open bounds. The mask raster is BOX-LOCAL: its own height/width,
placed at the record's bounds inside the frame. SAM caps the raster's
long side at 1024 px, so the raster may be SMALLER than its box; it is
scaled to the box (bilinear, on the unthresholded coverage) and
thresholded once at >= 129 before placement (`_fit_raster_to_box`).
The payload's first character selects the encoding: ``~`` lossless
(coverage raster, thresholded at >= 129 by the decoder) or ``!``
one_bit. An empty lane (no records) is a valid response meaning
"nothing matched".

Assumption recorded for the live verification: image responses use the
same ``<0f>`` frame-zero line as video frame 0 (the parser's image
format requires frame zero), and the segmentation text arrives as the
Responses API's ``output_text``.

    the same filter the SAM-frame-to-photo mapping uses) and the
